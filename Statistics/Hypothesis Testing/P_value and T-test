1. Visual Explanation (Conceptual)
Imagine two bell curves (normal distributions):

Group A:         Group B:
     /\              /\
    /  \            /  \
   /    \          /    \
  /      \        /      \
 /        \      /        \
------------    ------------
  Mean A         Mean B
When you perform a t-test, you ask:

Are these two curves (means) far apart because of a real effect, or could it just be random chance?

1.If the curves overlap a lot, it's likely random.

2.If the curves are far apart, the p-value becomes smaller (e.g., p = 0.03), meaning the difference is likely real.

2. Real-Life Example:
Study on Sleep vs Test Scores

Does sleeping 8 hours improve test scores compared to sleeping only 4 hours?

Group A: 10 students who slept 8 hours.

Group B: 10 students who slept 4 hours.

You collect test scores and run a t-test.

You get:

Group A average score = 85

Group B average score = 70

p-value = 0.01

Interpretation:
Since p = 0.01 < 0.05, the difference is statistically significant.

So you can confidently say that sleep affects test scores.
