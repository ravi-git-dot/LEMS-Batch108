AI VS ML VS DL vs DS

Artificial Intelligence
   -AI is the one process where we can be create application automatically it make to decesion
   quick response without human Interference
   Eg . amazon and Flicker Tesla car

Machine Learning
   - Machine Learning is a subset of AI and what is the role of machine learning it provide stats tools
     to analysis data, Visualization , prediction

Deep leaning
   - A subset of machine learning it main aim to mimic human brain create multi-learning neural-network
   to prediction of large project

Machine learning                          vs                       Deep learning
